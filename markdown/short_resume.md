Bio
----
Tyler Duzan is a 15+ year veteran of the tech industry. He got his start with computers
at a very young age, learning his first programming language (BASIC) at six years old.
As he got older his fascination with computers progressed into a passion for all things
technology with an emphasis on security. As part of exploring this passion he has learned
a broad range of technical skills including a deep understanding of Windows, Linux, and
networking. Tyler has begun applying his methodical data-driven approach
to decision making and strategic focus to business problems instead of technical problems
in his role as a Product Manager.

Tyler's top 10 Gallup Strengths are Arranger, Responsibility, Learner, Ideation, Activator,
Command, Achiever, Intellection, Input, Communication. His Myers-Briggs is INTJ. Tyler's
skill-set crosses business and technical boundaries, allowing me to solve almost any
problem with aplomb.
