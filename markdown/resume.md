Tyler Duzan is a 15+ year veteran of the tech industry. He got his start with computers
at a very young age, learning his first programming language (BASIC) at six years old.
As he got older his fascination with computers progressed into a passion for all things
technology with an emphasis on security. As part of exploring this passion he has learned
a broad range of technical skills including a deep understanding of Windows, Linux, and
networking. Tyler has begun applying his methodical data-driven approach
to decision making and strategic focus to business problems instead of technical problems
in his role as a Product Manager.  Most recently, Tyler has joined the team at ThousandEyes,
part of Cisco, to lead Agent Strategy growing the points of visibility around the world
running ThousandEyes Cloud and Enterprise Agents as well as overseeing the BGP product area.

My top 10 Gallup Strengths are Arranger, Responsibility, Learner, Ideation, Activator,
Command, Achiever, Intellection, Input, Communication. My Myers-Briggs is INTJ. I specialize
in problem-solving, absorbing and understanding complex systems, explaining these systems in
a simple manner, and producing excellent documentation. During my career I've architected,
implemented, deployed, and operated everything from a collection of small but business-critical
applications to the second largest public Cloud in the world. I also have demonstrated success
at reaching compliance goals and building things with security in mind. My skill-set crosses
business and technical boundaries, allowing me to solve almost any problem with aplomb.
